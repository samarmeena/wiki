## Returns

This function does not return any specific values.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerConnect(playerid)
{
    new h,m,s,str[50];
    gettime(h,m,s); // get the time
    format(str,50,"Connected: %d:%d:%d",h,m,s); // create the string with the connect time
    SetPVarString(playerid,"timeconnected",str); // save the string into a player variable
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

Variables aren't reset until after OnPlayerDisconnect is called, so the values are still accessible in OnPlayerDisconnect.
