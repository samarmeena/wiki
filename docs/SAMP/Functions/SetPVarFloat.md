        Float: x, Float: y, Float: z;

    GetPlayerPos(playerid, x, y, z); // Get the players position
    SetPVarFloat(playerid, "xpos", x); // Save the float into a player variable
    SetPVarFloat(playerid, "ypos", y); // Save the float into a player variable
    SetPVarFloat(playerid, "zpos", z); // Save the float into a player variable
    return 1;
}

## Notes

:::tip

Variables aren't reset until after OnPlayerDisconnect is called, so the values are still accessible in OnPlayerDisconnect.
