| Float:DrawDistance | The distance from which objects will appear to players. 0.0 will cause an object to render at its default distance. Leaving this parameter out will cause objects to be rendered at their default distance. The maximum usable distance is 300 in versions prior to 0.3x, in which drawdistance can be unlimited. |

## Returns

The ID of the object that was created, or INVALID_OBJECT_ID if the object limit (MAX_OBJECTS) was reached.

## Examples

```c
new gObject[MAX_PLAYERS];

public OnPlayerConnect(playerid)
{
    gObject[playerid] = CreatePlayerObject(playerid, 2587, 2001.195679, 1547.113892, 14.283400, 0, 0, 96);

    // Or alternatively, using the DrawDistance parameter to show it from as far away as possible:
    gObject[playerid] = CreatePlayerObject(playerid, 2587, 2001.195679, 1547.113892, 14.283400, 0, 0, 96, 300.0);
    return 1;
}

public OnPlayerDisconnect(playerid, reason)
{
    DestroyPlayerObject(playerid, gObject[playerid]);
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::warning

The 'DrawDistance' parameter was added in 0.3b. It must be left out in scripts for older versions of SA:MP.
