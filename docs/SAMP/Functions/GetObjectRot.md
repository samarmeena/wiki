Use this function to get the objects current rotation. The rotation is saved by reference in three RotX/RotY/RotZ variables.

| Name     | Description                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| objectid | The objectid of the object you want to get the rotation from. |
| &Float:X | The variable to store the X rotation, passed by reference.    |
| &Float:Y | The variable to store the Y rotation, passed by reference.    |
| &Float:Z | The variable to store the Z rotation, passed by reference.    |

## Returns

The object's rotation is stored in the referenced variables, not in the return value.

new Float:RotX,Float:RotY,Float:RotZ;
GetObjectRot(objectid, RotX, RotY, RotZ);
```
