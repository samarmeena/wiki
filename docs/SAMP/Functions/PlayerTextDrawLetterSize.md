## Returns

This function does not return any specific values.

## Examples

```c
gMyTextDraw[playerid] = CreatePlayerTextDraw(playerid, 100.0, 33.0,"Example TextDraw");
PlayerTextDrawLetterSize(playerid, gMyTextDraw[playerid], 3.2 ,5.1);
```

## Notes

:::tip

When using this function purely for the benefit of affecting the textdraw box, multiply 'Y' by 0.135 to convert to TextDrawTextSize-like measurements

:::

:::tip

Fonts appear to look the best with an X to Y ratio of 1 to 4 (e.g. if x is 0.5 then y should be 2).
